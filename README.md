# Mining-Massive-Datasets
This repository contains a series of tasks performed on the large scale Yelp dataset.
1. The first task involves finding the near-duplicate reviews using Locality-sensitive hashing and its runtime comparison to naively calculating duplicates.
2. Task 2 involves heavy data pre-processing on sparse matrices and subsequent rating prediction using Alternating Optimisation and Latent Factorisation using Gradient Descent.
